# AI Autonomous Development Team Framework

This framework is designed to simulate an AI development team capable of understanding tasks, managing code, and learning from its actions.

## Modules

- `nlp_module.py`: Processes natural language instructions into actionable tasks.
- `file_management_module.py`: Manages and understands the state of the project files.
- `code_gen_module.py`: Generates and refines code autonomously.
- `research_module.py`: Researches the latest technologies and libraries.
- `version_control_module.py`: Integrates with version control systems like Git.
- `learning_module.py`: Learns from past actions to improve future performance.

## Usage

Each module contains placeholder logic that needs to be implemented with specific AI models and custom code as per project requirements.
